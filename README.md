# Welcome to my profile!
I'm Miyuki! A curious and... totally creative software engineer who's always up for a challenge from a crazy idea. I love learning new things and building cool stuff, whether it's compilers or games or whatever. My GitHub account is mostly a dumping ground for my random coding projects and experiments. (with a few diamonds in the rough like ANE and LibORM)

## Thingy I'm actively working on
- [LabORM](https://github.com/MiyukiNozomi/LabORM) - An early-stage still-to-be-production-ready prismaJS-like ORM but only implemented in TypeScript (and with less support for certain databases)
- [ANE](https://github.com/MiyukiNozomi/ANE) - My website of course! this repository might not have anything important for you, but it could be interesting if you want to know how any of my microservices work.

## Your support keeps me going!
Like or use any of my maintained ideas? if you wish to support your favorite project: I accept Bitcoin donations! as...
