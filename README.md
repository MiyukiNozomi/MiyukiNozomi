### Welcome to my profile!
I write compilers, scripting languages, games, websites and whatever I find cool!

# What will I find here?
Well.. mostly backups of my projects in my [website](https://ane.jp.net)'s [Git microservice](https://git.ane.jp.net)

## Things I'm actively working on
[LabORM](https://github.com/MiyukiNozomi/LabORM) - A prismaJS-like ORM but only implemented in TypeScript (and with less support for certain databases)
[ANE](https://github.com/MiyukiNozomi/ANE) - My website of course! this repository might not have anything important for you, but it could be interesting.
