### Welcome to my profile!
I write compilers, scripting languages, games, websites and whatever I find cool!

Warning: **I no longer publically post personal repositories here**

# As of 2024/2025...
All my personal projects are now located in my personal website (still using git, and I wrote the git backend!)
This account is now only used for freelancer and other corporate related work.
